Virtual Board helps to draw on a screen just by gestures of your finger. In this project I used the Computer Vision techniques of OpenCV. Currently we are using simple physical board so we cannot place it from one place to another place. But with invention we don't require any physical or Digital board. It only requires Computer with a webcam.
